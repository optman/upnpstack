/*
 *	High Level Description.
 *
 *	RendererStateLogic.h and RendererStateLogic.c provide the logic for
 *	a MediaRenderer state machine. The module is probably not too useful
 *	to customers that already have a state machine for an existing rendering device.
 *	Such customers probably want to have their current solution interface
 *	directly with the MicroMediaRenderer module.
 *
 *	That being said, this module abstracts the following tasks from the
 *	upper application layers:
 *
 *		-provides callbacks to instruct the rendering framework to perform streaming
 *		 related state changes
 *
 *		-provide the upper application layer the means to instruct the
 *		 renderer state machine to handle next,previous,etc. actions.
 *		
 *		-provide the upper applicaiton layer the means to report the rendering
 *		 framework's current state
 *
 *		-provide the upper application layer the means to report a target URI and
 *		 other playlist related information
 *
 *		-provides a callback to request a target URI from a playlist

 *	Developers may be able to reduce code size by changing these

 *	In our experience, if the implementation uses a statically

 *	smaller. See MicroMediaRenderer.h for an example of this technique
 *	at work.
