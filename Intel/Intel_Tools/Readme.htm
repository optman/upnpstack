<h1><b>Intel's UPnP Tools Package</b></h1>

<p>This package is provided as-is, without support and without any guaranties. It 
is not an official Intel product, so please don't call Intel support. We 
appreciate feedback on the tools, especially in relation to interoperability 
issues, but our lab is not staffed to respond to support questions. Many of the 
tools are work in progress. For example: Some menus selections may not work or 
have limitations, etc...<br>
<br>
UPnP Tools .EXE's are not Win32 applications, they are .NET binaries and require 
Microsoft's .NET Framework to be installed. It is a 20 megabyte package 
available on the Microsoft Update Web site or on the MSDN web site at:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?URL=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/829/msdncompositedoc.xml">
http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?URL=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/829/msdncompositedoc.xml</a><br>
<br>
UPnP Tools have been known to work on Windows XP and Windows NT4, they should 
also work on Windows98 and higher, but we did not conduct any testing on these 
platforms. Service Pack 6 is required when installing the .NET framework on NT4.</p>

<p><b>Contact Information</b></p>

<p>Intel is always looking for feedback, especially in regards to interoperation 
issues. Intel is also working on code generation authoring tools that are 
available for trial. To submit feedback or receive a trial of the Intel UPnP 
code generation tools contact:</p>

<p><b>What new in the release?</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>AV Control Points (AV Wizard and AV Controller) now generate Extended M3U 
  play lists. New menu options to turn this feature off. Note that the AV 
  Renderer uses the Media Player ActiveX control that does not support 
  Extended-M3U.</li>
  <li>New debugging interface for all the tools. This is generally located in 
  the Help menu of the tools.</li>
  <li>Fixed many problems: AV Renderer event escaping, handling invalid SID 
  events and much more.</li>
  <li>PrepareForConnection is now removed by default in the AV Renderer.</li>
  <li>Added a new PocketPC Media Renderer tool in the &quot;Micro Tools&quot; directory.</li>
  <li>New help file attached to all of the Tools.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><b>Intel Device Spy</b> - is the premier Universal Plug &amp; Play Universal 
Control Point (UCP). It allows UPnP device detection, display of detailed 
information on every aspect of a UPnP device, action invocation, event 
monitoring and error handling. The application is built with a solid, easy to 
use, user interface and leverages Intel's Universal Plug &amp; Play CLR stack.</p>
<p><b>Intel Service Author</b> - is an easy to use SCPD XML authoring tool. 
Creating and maintaining UPnP services is now extremely simple, our SCDP 
parser will also generate and validate the document for compliance. Service 
Author includes a C# code generator, this feature is not useful 
  outside of Intel.</p>
<p><b>Intel Device Sniffer</b> - monitors all UPnP broadcast traffic on the 
network. Solving SSDP interoperation problems has never been easier. The 
application can filter packets and issue SSDP searches, very useful for  plug fests events. </p>
<p><b>Intel Device Validator</b> - is a battery of tests that can be applied to 
any UPnP device. Validator includes tests that apply to all devices, and AV 
specific tests for AV Renderers and AV Content Directory Servers (CDS).</p>
<p><b>Intel Device Scriptor</b> - an easy to use UPnP scripting application. 
Allows the user to quickly build scenario scripts and run them against UPnP 
devices.</p>
<p><b>Intel AV Media Controller</b> - is a fully features UPnP AV Control 
Point. It is equivalent to Device Spy for AV. AV Media Controller looks for all renderers and content directories on the network, it virtualizes all of the 
media content for rapid searching, dynamically builds play lists for renderers 
that support it, supports single and multi-instance renderers and much more. 
This is the must have, UPnP AV application.</p>
<p>Additional notes on UPnP Media Controller:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right click on a renderer and select &quot;Renderer Controls&quot; for more renderer 
  options.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Intel AV Media Server</b> - is complete UPnP AV Content Directory. It 
uses the file system as a database allowing the user to drag &amp; drop folders for 
quick sharing of media. Media Server's user interface also allows tracking of 
downloaded files.</p>
<p>Additional notes on&nbsp; AV Media Server:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can drag &amp; drop folders onto the user interface or use the &quot;add shared 
  folder&quot; menu option.</li>
  <li>MP3 ID3 version 1 tags, GIF and JPEG metadata is supported. Other file 
  types will show up with generic metadata.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Intel AV Media Renderer</b> - a fully features UPnP AV renderer. Supports 
multi-instance, play lists support, complete moderated eventing, track seeking support, 
position seeking support and much more.</p>
<p>Additional notes on AV Media Renderer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Run AV Media Renderer and select the features and MIME types the renderer will 
  support. Once everything is setup, select &quot;Start Renderer&quot; from the File menu.</li>
  <li>Many UPnP properties including NextContentURI and many display attributes 
  don't have any effect, but are left for testing purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Intel AV Wizard</b> - is an UPnP AV control point for playing locally 
stored content to available AV renderers. The goal if to make this application 
integrate well within Windows XP as a shell extension. Select a renderer and 
drag &amp; drop a file into AV Wizard to start playing.</p>
<p><b>Intel Network Light</b> - Also included in the package is a simple UPnP 
home automation light that can be used to demonstrate the basic abilities of 
both Device Spy and Service Author. </p>

<p><b>Intel Device Relay</b> - Mirrors UPnP Device onto a different network. 
Start Device Relay on two different computers and use a WAN interface to connect 
one to the other. UPnP Relay will automatically mirror all other devices from 
one network on to the other. Relayed devices will appear with a star (*) in 
front of their names. SSDP messages are handled locally by the relay, events and 
action invocations are forwarded to the source relay using SOAP.</p>

<hr>
<p><font size="4"><b>Internationalization</b></font></p>
<p>All tools should work with large fonts and with any display DPI settings. 
Please report any problems.</p>
<p>Intel Device Spy and Network Light as been localized to French. It will run 
in French on a French computer. Users can override the language setting with the &quot;-fr&quot; 
(French) and &quot;-en&quot; (English) command line parameter.</p>
